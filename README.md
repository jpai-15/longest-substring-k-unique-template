# Longest Substring with K Unique Characters

## Problem Statement

Write a Python function that finds the longest substring of a given string that contains exactly `K` unique characters. If no such substring exists, return 0.

### Function Signature:
```python
def longest_substring_k_unique(s: str, k: int) -> int:
```

### Example Input/Output:
1. **Example 1**:
   ```
   Input: S = "araaci", K = 2
   Output: 4
   Explanation: The longest substring with exactly 2 unique characters is "araa".
   ```

2. **Example 2**:
   ```
   Input: S = "cbbebi", K = 3
   Output: 5
   Explanation: The longest substring with exactly 3 unique characters is "cbbeb" or "bbebi".
   ```

3. **Example 3**:
   ```
   Input: S = "aa", K = 1
   Output: 2
   Explanation: The longest substring with exactly 1 unique character is "aa".
   ```

### Constraints:
1. The string `S` will have at least one character and at most 10^6 characters.
2. The integer `K` will be between 1 and the number of distinct characters in the string.

     ```

6. **Push the Changes**:
   - Push your changes to the `gcd-feature` branch on your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin gcd-feature
     ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "Compare & pull request" button to create a pull request back to the original repository.
   - Make sure you are comparing your `gcd-feature` branch with the `main` branch of the original repository.
   - Submit the pull request.
